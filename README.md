# inet_4031_adduser_script

## Description

This repository contains a Python script designed to automate the process of adding multiple users and their respective groups to a Linux system. The purpose of this script is to streamline the configuration of new or existing systems by reading from a predefined input file that lists all the users to be added. This approach eliminates the need for manual user creation, making it especially useful for administrators managing a large number of systems.

The repository also includes a sample input file, `create-users.input`, which serves as a template for specifying the user data in a structured format. This script is intended to demonstrate basic principles of automation with Python in a Linux environment.

## Operation

### Preparing the Environment

Before running the script, ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can verify this by running `python3 --version` in your terminal. If Python 3 is not installed, you will need to install it using your distribution's package manager.

### Running the Script

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aget2101/inet_4031_adduser_script.git
